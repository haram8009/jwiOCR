# This is a placeholder for your OpenAI API key. You can get one from https://platform.openai.com/signup
# It is recommended to use a .env file to store sensitive information like API keys.
# You can create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add the key there.
# For example:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# You can also set the key as an environment variable in your operating system.
# For example, in Linux or MacOS, you can run:
# export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
# In Windows, you can run:
# set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
